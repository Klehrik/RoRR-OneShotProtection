### v1.0.0
* Initial release

### v1.0.1
* No longer overrides higher invulnerability effects (like from Shield Generator).

### v1.0.2
* Added installation instructions to the main page.

### v1.0.3
* Made optimizations (to a few of my mods) to reduce load.
* Adjusted max damage calculation a bit; it's now (max health * 0.9) + current barrier.
* Updated Installation Instructions.

### v1.0.4
* Added a damage window for OSP to take effect.
    * Generally you don't instantly die from a single hit, but rather several instances of damage at once, which the previous implementation did not protect against (if you want to keep that behavior, just keep using v1.0.3).
* Increases iframes from 30 -> 45.

### v1.0.5
* Updated all my mods to use a single helper file.
* Updated installation instructions to use the mod manager instead.
